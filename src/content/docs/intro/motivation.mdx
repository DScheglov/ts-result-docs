The **resultage** library is aims to  enhance the type safety of programs by
explicitly declaring business logic errors and leveraging the type system to
ensure accurate error handling and communication.

On both backend and frontend, typing business logic errors enables consistent
mapping to API contract errors and user-visible messages respectively.

By typing errors, we mean returning them as values from functions rather than
throwing them.

<Aside type="note">
TypeScript does not provide a way to specify which exceptions a function might
throw or even if it throws any exceptions.
</Aside>

While throwing exceptions has a clear advantage — exceptions are automatically 
propagated up the call stack until caught — dealing with errors as values 
requires explicit handling at each level. This forces the caller to 
handle the error in one of the following ways:

- Return the error received, transforming it into another error if needed
- Recover from the error and proceed with the next operation
- Throw an exception

These approaches can become verbose and make the code less readable, 
often resulting in numerous if statements.

To mitigate this trade-off, the **resultage** library offers a set of tools 
to work with errors as values in a "monadic" way, similar to how 
exceptions are handled.

## Does Result Replace Exceptions?

No, `Result` does not replace exceptions; it complements them by providing a way
to handle expected errors explicitly. 

The **expected errors** — those that occur when all the function's assumed or
asserted conditions are met, but the desired outcome cannot be achieved.
Exceptions are reserved for **unexpected errors** — those that happen when at
least one of the function's assumed or asserted conditions is not met.

Let's look on the Payment Processing. 

We assume both that the payment gateway service is available and that the user's
input — such as card number, expiration date, and security code — is valid and
correctly formatted. Expected errors occur when these assumptions are met but
the payment is still declined due to reasons like insufficient funds, expired
cards, or suspected fraud. We handle these expected errors using Result to return
explicit error information that the program can manage gracefully.

Unexpected errors arise when our assumptions are violated — for example, if the
payment gateway is unavailable (an infrastructure issue) or if the user's input
is invalid or malformed (e.g., incorrect card number format or missing required
fields). These unexpected errors indicate that the assumed conditions are not
met, and we handle them by throwing exceptions, signaling that a fundamental
issue needs special attention or higher-level error handling.

So, the signature of a function that processes a payment might look like this:

```typescript
type PaymentSuccess = {
  transactionId: string;
  transactionDate: Date;
};

type PaymentError = {
  code: 'ERR_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS' | 'ERR_EXPIRED_CARD' | 'ERR_SUSPECTED_FRAUD';
  message?: string;
};

/**
 * Process a payment using the provided card information.
 * 
 * @throws An exception if the payment gateway is unavailable or the input is invalid.
 */
function processPayment(
  amount: number,
  currency: string,
  cardNumber: string,
  expirationDate: string,
  securityCode: string,
): Promise<Result<PaymentSuccess, PaymentError>>;
```

Now, let's change this assumption and consider that the payment gateway might
be offline or unavailable at times. This adjustment affects how we classify
errors and how we handle them in our code.

```typescript
// --- snip ---
type PaymentError = {
  code: 'ERR_GATEWAY_UNAVAILABLE' | 'ERR_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS' | 'ERR_EXPIRED_CARD' | 'ERR_SUSPECTED_FRAUD';
  message?: string;
};
// --- snip ---
```

And if we assume that the user's input might be invalid, we should adjust the
error type accordingly:

```typescript
// --- snip ---
type PaymentError = {
  code:
   | 'ERR_GATEWAY_UNAVAILABLE'
   | 'ERR_INVALID_CARD_NUMBER'
   | 'ERR_INVALID_EXPIRATION_DATE'
   | 'ERR_INVALID_SECURITY_CODE'
   | 'ERR_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS'
   | 'ERR_EXPIRED_CARD'
   | 'ERR_SUSPECTED_FRAUD';
  message?: string;
};
// --- snip ---
```

## Summary

- **Exceptions** handle **unexpected errors**.
- `Result` handles **expected errors**.
- To classify errors as expected or unexpected:
  - Define the **desired outcome**: Understand what the function is supposed to achieve.
  - Define the **assumptions** regarding the function's input and environment.
